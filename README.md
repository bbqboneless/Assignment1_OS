# Assignment1_OS
The excercises contained in this assignment are explained as follows:

EXCERCISE 1 (ex1.sh)
-> The aim of this excercise was to create a script that when run in the terminal, would print the string "Hello World!". For that, the command echo followed by the string were written.

EXCERCISE 2 (ex2.sh)
-> The aim of the excercise was to check the Current Working Directory as well as the Disk Usage. For that, the commands pwd and du ./* were used. And other sorting and visualization commands were added.

EXCERCISE 3 (ex3.sh)
-> The aim of the excercise was to visualize some information about the user, and date and calendar were displayed using the date, who and cal commands.

EXERCISE 4 (ex4.sh)
-> The aim of this excercise was to make a file backup for all the ".c" files contained in the directory. For that, a for loop was used and the cp command was used with the ".back" extension.

EXCERCISE 5 (ex5.sh)
-> The aim of this excercise was to create a while loop that counted from 1 to 10 and expressed the counting update.

EXCERCISE 6 (ex6.sh)
-> This excercise was a little bit difficult since the goal was to create directories, logs, ".c" files and create backups. That's why, the content was not that good, and was very difficult to execute. The code can be seen in the "ex6.sh" file.
